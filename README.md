# CCQS V1 — Composite Chart Quality Score

**Daily technical, momentum, and strength screening tool** for L/S discretionary equity analysis.

Production system: scores ~860 stocks/ETFs across ~148 thematic baskets every weekday at 4:05 PM ET (5 min after NYSE close). Live dashboard at **[composite-chart-quality-score.streamlit.app](https://composite-chart-quality-score.streamlit.app/)**.

## What it does

CCQS produces a **0–100 chart-quality score** and **S/A/B/C/D grade** for each name, plus three categorical labels that describe what the chart is doing right now:

| Layer | Labels | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| **State** | Trending · Pullback · Consolidating · Parabolic · Breaking Down · No Edge | What's the current trend regime? |
| **Leadership Tier** | Elite Leader → Strong Leader → Established Leader → Emerging Leader → Steady → Neutral → Weak Performer → Fading Leader → Weak Laggard · No RS Signal | What kind of RS profile does it have today? |
| **Setup** | New High · Breakout · Failed Breakout · Tight Base · Coiling · Shallow Pullback · Deep Pullback · Extended · At Highs · Basing Low · Breakdown · Reclaim · Sideways · (blank) | What chart pattern does the recent price action match? |

See [USER_GUIDE.md](USER_GUIDE.md) for the institutional interpretation guide and [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) for the full methodology specification.

STREAMLIT CLOUD (display layer ONLY)
Entry: app/streamlit_app.py
  • Reads parquets from data/cache/dashboard/
  • Renders tables, sidebar filters, stock detail panel
  • Does NOT compute CCQS / state / leadership / setups
  • Does NOT touch yfinance
```

**Compute happens on GitHub Actions, not Streamlit.** Streamlit is purely the display layer reading committed parquets. If Streamlit is down, the next morning's compute still runs on schedule; scores just won't be viewable until it's back.

---

## Setup (local development)

Requires Python 3.13.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/schhabra2003/Composite-Chart-Quality-Score.git
cd Composite-Chart-Quality-Score
python3.13 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Daily pipeline (manual run)

```bash
python -m compute.loader              # 1. fetch OHLCV from yfinance
python -m compute.data_quality        # 2. quality firewall
python -m compute.features            # 3. derive 108 features
python -m compute.standardization     # 4. cross-sectional z-scores
python -m compute.pipeline            # 5. CCQS / state / leadership / setup
python -m compute.build_dashboard_cache  # 6. slim parquets for Streamlit
```

Or run the dashboard locally against the cached data:

```bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
```

## Quality gates (auto-run by CI before any cache commit)

| Gate | What it catches |
|---|---|
| **TradingView reference parity** — 140 pinned field checks across 10 large-cap canaries | Methodology drift |
| **Pipeline integrity** — 11 sanity checks (CCQS bounded, state probs sum to 1, no inf values, etc.) | Computation errors |
| **Universe coverage** — yfinance fetched ≥95% of declared universe | yfinance regressions |
| **Cache freshness** — latest date within 7 days | Stale data |
| **IC baseline** — per-date IC vs Phase 11 baseline within tolerance | Forward-return regressions |

If any hard-gate fails, the workflow fails and no new cache is committed. Yesterday's good cache stays in place.

## Phase status

System is **fully deployed and live in production**. Phase numbering reflects iterative methodology refinements; see CHANGELOG.md for the full audit trail.

| Phase | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1–22 | Foundation, methodology, deployment, UI cleanup | ✅ Shipped |
| 23 | Add major recent IPOs to universe | ✅ |
| 24 | Graceful CCQS degradation for partial-history names | ✅ |
| 25 | Setup label redesign (27-label → 12-cascade; Phase 27 made it 13) | ✅ |
| 26 | State + Leadership Tier display rename + cron move | ✅ |
| 27 | Setup cascade bug fix + "Reclaim" label (13th) | ✅ |
| 28 | s_demand permanently removed + 0-weight rows hidden | ✅ |
| 29 | 30 unused features dropped + Methodology section trim | ✅ |
| 30 | "Magnificent Seven" CORE basket added; AAPL moved out of Hyperscalers | ✅ |
